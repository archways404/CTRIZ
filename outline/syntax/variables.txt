VARIABLES:

  When declaring variables you must use the "var" keyword followed by the type of variable you are declaring. Keep in mind that you can change the value of a variable at any time.

  You can declare it with a value or without a value.

  With a value:
  
    [var] [type] [variableName] = [value];
  
  Without an initial value:
  
    [var] [type] [variableName];

    To then assign a value to the variable you can do so by using the "=" operator.

    [variableName] = [value];

CONSTANTS:

  When declaring constants you must use the "const" keyword followed by the type of variable you are declaring. Keep in mind that you can not change a value of a "const" variable once it has been declared.

  You can declare it with a value or without a value.

  With a value:
  
    [var] [type] [variableName] = [value];
  
  Without an initial value:
  
    [var] [type] [variableName];

    To then assign a value to the variable you can do so by using the "=" operator.

    [variableName] = [value];


INTEGER:

  With initial value:

    var int variableName = 5;
  
  Without initial value:

    var int variableName;

    variableName = 5;


FLOAT:

  With initial value:

    var float variableName = 5.5;
  
  Without initial value:

    var float variableName;

    variableName = 5.5;


BOOLEAN:

  With initial value:

    var bool variableName = true;
  
  Without initial value:

    var bool variableName;

    variableName = true;


CHARACTER (string):

  With initial value:

    var char variableName = 'a';
  
  Without initial value:

    var char variableName;

    variableName = 'a';


STRING:

  With initial value:

    var str variableName = 'a';
  
  Without initial value:

    var str variableName;

    variableName = 'a';
