POINTERS:

To define a pointer:

  var ptr int myPointer;

    You can also define it with a null value by default:

    var ptr int myPointer = null;

To get the address of a value (pointer):

  var int value = 10;
  
  var ptr int myPointer = &value; // Get address of 'value'

To get the value at a pointer:

  var int dereferencedValue = *myPointer; // Get value at pointer



To allocate memory for a pointer:

  var ptr int myPointer = alloc(4); // Allocate space for an int
  *myPointer = 42; // Store value in allocated memory

  free(myPointer);
